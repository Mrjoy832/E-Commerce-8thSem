### - How EDI WORKS:
Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is a standardized electronic communication method used to exchange business documents and data between trading partners. Here's an overview of how EDI works:

1. Establishing the Connection: Trading partners agree to use EDI and establish a connection between their respective computer systems. This can be done through direct connections or through a value-added network (VAN) service provider.

2. Document Mapping: Both parties agree on the specific EDI standards and formats they will use for exchanging documents. Common standards include ANSI X12, UN/EDIFACT, and XML. Each business document, such as purchase orders, invoices, or shipping notices, is mapped to the corresponding EDI format.

3. Data Translation: The sender's computer system converts the business document into the agreed-upon EDI format. This involves mapping the data fields from the internal system to the corresponding EDI segments and elements.

4. Transmission: The EDI document is transmitted from the sender's system to the receiver's system over the established connection. This can be done using various protocols, including FTP (File Transfer Protocol), AS2 (Applicability Statement 2), or web services.

5. Validation and Acknowledgment: The receiver's system receives the EDI document and performs validation checks to ensure the data's integrity and compliance with the agreed-upon standards. The receiver generates an acknowledgment, known as an EDI acknowledgment or EDI 997, to confirm successful receipt and processing of the document.

6. Data Processing: Once the EDI document is validated, the receiver's system extracts the data from the EDI format and integrates it into their internal systems for further processing. This may involve updating databases, triggering workflows, or generating response documents.

7. Error Handling and Exception Management: If errors or exceptions occur during the EDI process, such as missing or incorrect data, both parties follow predefined protocols to address and resolve the issues. This may involve sending error notifications, requesting document corrections, or initiating manual interventions.

8. Business Process Integration: The exchanged EDI data is integrated into the respective business processes of the trading partners. This can include automated order processing, inventory updates, billing, and other transactional activities, improving efficiency and reducing manual efforts.

9. Audit Trail and Archiving: Both parties maintain a record of the EDI transactions, including the original documents, acknowledgments, and any related communications. This audit trail helps with tracing and resolving any disputes or discrepancies that may arise.

EDI enables seamless and standardized exchange of business documents between trading partners, eliminating the need for paper-based transactions, manual data entry, and associated errors. It streamlines business processes, reduces costs, enhances data accuracy, and improves overall efficiency and collaboration in supply chains.
